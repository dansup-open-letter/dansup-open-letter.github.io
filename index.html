      <h1>An open letter to NLnet to pull funding from development of Loops</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="letter">
      <p>
        dansup, the maintainer of Pixelfed, Loops (which NLnet helps fund), and
        FediDB, among others, is a dangerous force in the fediverse community.
        With a follower count of over 22 thousand, he has repeatedly shown
        himself to be hostile to fellow FOSS fediverse developers, have a
        lack of care for open-sourcing his work, and be in favour of injecting
        the fediverse with advertisements. He has also proved himself to be
        prone to conspiratorial thinking, regrettable public statements, and
        embarrassingly public meltdowns.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, the undersigned, believe that dansup's actions, culminating in the
        public meltdown of 2024-12-30, are not merely isolated incidents, but
        a pattern of hostility, deflection, lack of accountability, appeal to
        emotion, and tactlessness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We urge NLnet to pull funding from Loops immediately</b>. We have
        compiled a recounting of events highlighting dansup's unprofessionalism
        and hostility towards developers smaller than him, which can be found <a
        href="appendix/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We urge dansup to temporarily step down from maintainership
        positions</b>, and to take a break from fedi. We acknowledge that these
        actions are likely the result of burnout from being overworked and
        underappreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We believe dansup has done a lot of good for the fediverse as an
        ecosystem</b>. We acknowledge the large userbase of Pixelfed, a project
        spearheaded and maintained by dansup; we additionally acknowledge the
        work that he has done championing the fediverse and putting time and
        effort into developing tools and platforms for it. However, we remain
        confident that dansup's actions are unacceptable behaviour coming from
        a project maintainer, especially considering his position of power
        relative to his peers, and that he should rethink this behaviour.

      <h2>Conflict of interest</h2>
      <p>
        This open letter has been authored by contributors who wish to remain
        anonymous. The authors, as well as some of the undersigned, are friends
        and acquaintances of hazycora, and as such, we acknowledge any potential
        conflicts of interest stemming from our relationship. Nonetheless, we
        insist that dansup's actions towards Hazel and others are unacceptable,
        and that his grant should be revoked.
      </p>
      <p>
        hazycora has provided screenshots of private conversations with dansup,
        and has confirmed the accuracy of the appendix prior to publishing.
        pixeldesu has provided the authors with links to now-deleted public
        posts by dansup. Neither had any other control over the appendix and did
        not write any portion of it.
