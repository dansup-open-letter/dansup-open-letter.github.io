      <h2>Foreword</h2>
      <p>
        The following is a list of dansup's public and private statements to and
        about himself, smaller FOSS maintainers, the fediverse itself, and the
        free and open source ecosystem at large.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>Stance on open-source software</h2>
      <p>
        dansup describes himself as an OSS fediverse developer, citing his work
        including Pixelfed and FediDB. Despite these claims, FediDB is not fully
        open-source; the actual software featured on the FediDB website differs
        from the AGPL-licensed <a href="https://github.com/fedidb/fedidb-ce">"community
        edition"</a> that hasn't been updated in four years.
      </p>
      <div class="quote">
        <p>
          I have released the source code here and will be opening up
          <a href="https://fedidb.org">https://fedidb.org</a> to everyone in the
          coming days.
        </p>
        <p>
          FediDB.org has grown beyond just developer tools, you can browse the
          network, discover ActivityPub projects or find other community
          resources!
        </p>
        <p>
          The more I work on this, the more I realize that I cannot do it alone.
          This project has a lot of potential and should be stewarded by a
          community organization once it’s more stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have a nice day 😃

        He explained that the reason the repository hasn't been updated is
        because he uses a paid Laravel theme for the hosted version, which, if
        true, would make the current version not open-source.

          @beacondb The issue is I'm using a paid theme for the current version,
          so I have to rewrite it with an open source one to not violate any
          licences.

        hazycora (Hazel), a FOSS developer who worked on reverse-engineering the

      <p>
        Another FOSS developer, pixeldesu, was vaguely threatened with legal
        action for attempting to reverse-engineer the Loops API and publishing
        his findings.

          @pixel I wasn't expecting this, and even though it violates our ToS, I

          Officially I'm not impressed, unofficially I am impressed and won't
          hinder unauthorized 3rd party access.

          Btw, you and @h should help me define the v1 schema, I'm aware of 3

          an official fashion!
        </p>
        <p>
          This would normally lead to legal action, but here in the fediverse,

      <p>
        In a now-deleted poll posted to his account, dansup was gauging interest
        in the incorporation of adsinto Loops. <a href="https://archive.md/mCSXn">When
        approached by Hazel</a>, he both denied his post being a serious inquiry
        and defended the prospective addition of ads to the platform.

          <br />at best it was a thought exercise, but really i just wanted to
          do a few polls to test federation polls with loops</br>
          if you look at my comments/replies, a lot of people actually support
          this<br />
          and they would never federate, and only be applied to the official

        After Hazel <a href="../media/IMG_7597.png">expressed disinterest</a> in

        <a href="../media/IMG_7598.png">blocked her on Discord</a>.

        He has since denied ever having considered adding ads to Loops,
        asserting his original poll was a joke, and reaffirming that Loops will
        stay ad-free.

          Never ever did I say Loops would have ads, but here you are,

      <h2>Appeal to emotion</h2>
      <p>
        In response to criticism, dansup has claimed that he is being treated
        unfairly for being the only gay and indigenous fedi developer.

          As a queer and indigenous developer, I've struggled with acceptance
          and hateful replies and even being called out for using the "yall"
          phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope my fellow cree and other indigenous devs don't have to face the
          same fate.
        </p>

          While it can be hard sometimes, don't forget where you came from, and
          don't take no shit from anyone.

          Go ahead, hate on the only indigenous and gay fediverse dev.

          I'll still be here building, for everyone.

          I've never played this card, because I never thought I'd have to, but
          it does kinda feel a bit racsist how some indian like me has to go
          beyond to prove his worth.

      <p>
        On one occasion, dansup banned the Loops accounts of everyone registered
        under the email domain <code>hazy.gay</code>, claiming that one parody
        account registered under said domain that impersonated Kamala Harris was
        a political grift.

          @yassie_j you or whoever manages your mail domain registered a fake
          Kamala account, which violates our terms as clearly described.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot impersonate a brand or person. This wasn't the only one
          though, there were a few others too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take your grift elsewhere lmao

          yeah, if you don't want your Loops account banned, maybe don't
          impersonate a presidential candidate, and act clueless when you are
          associated with malicious actors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe take your political grifts somewhere else, loops.video isn't
          the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But keep your "freeze peach" to yourself bro, we don't need your kind
          here.

          (btw, this person is using the same email domain as h, the one who is
          crashing out because I didn't want her to join our team)

        Later, in response to a supportive Russian-language reply, he claimed
        that the banned accounts supported Trump, and that the users operating
        them are Russian state actors.

          @yuriiname ngl, their shady ties to the Russian regime with their
          Kamala fake account is pretty evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you join Loops and make such a political statement like that,
          basically supporting trump, it makes you wonder what side they on!
